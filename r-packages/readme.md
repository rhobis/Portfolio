Packages on CRAN
----------------

**ConvergenceClubs**
([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ConvergenceClubs),
[GitHub](https://github.com/rhobis/ConvergenceClubs)) provides functions
for clustering regions that form convergence clubs, according to the
definition by Phillips and Sul (2009). A showcase of the package may be
found in this
[paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019/RJ-2019-021/index.html).

**bootstrapFP**
([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootstrapFP/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/rhobis/bootstrapFP/)) provides bootstrap
algorithms for Finite Population inference, for estimating the variance
of the Horvitz–Thompson estimator.

**jipApprox**
([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jipApprox/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/rhobis/jipApprox/)) provides functions to
approximate joint–inclusion probabilities in Unequal Probability
Sampling, or to find Monte Carlo approximations of first and
second–order inclusion probabilities of a general sampling design.

**UPSvarApprox**
([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/UPSvarApprox/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/rhobis/UPSvarApprox/)) provides functions
for the approximation of the variance of the Horvitz–Thompson total
estimator in Unequal Probability Sampling using only first-order
inclusion probabilities.

Other packages
--------------

**robustHT** ([GitHub](https://github.com/rhobis/robustHT)) is a simple
package for obtaining the conditional bias of the Horvitz–Thompson
estimator and for estimating the Robust Horvitz–Thompson Estimator
(Beaumont, Haziza and Ruiz-Gazen, 2013).

**FPdust** ([GitHub](https://github.com/rhobis/FPdust)) implements the
FPDUST (Fattorini and Ridolfi, 1997) and PPS FPDUST (Barabesi et al.,
1997) spatial sampling designs for Finite Populations.
